# Threat model: cross-user access, token theft, prompt injection, artifact filenames

Written as part of the Phase 7 security-hardening pass (see `plan.md`). Most
of the concrete mitigations already existed in the code from earlier rounds;
this note collects them in one place, names what's still an accepted risk,
and points at the file that owns each mitigation so future changes don't
regress it silently.

## Cross-user access

**Risk**: user A reads/writes user B's chat sessions, messages, artifacts, or
provider credentials.

**Mitigated**:

- Every REST route that touches a session-scoped resource calls
  `ChatSessionsService.getOwned(userId, sessionId)` before doing anything
  else (`backend/src/chat/chat-sessions.controller.ts`,
  `backend/src/artifacts/artifacts.controller.ts`) — a 404/403 there stops
  the request before any data lookup.
- `ProviderSettingsService` no longer stores or scopes any per-user data at all
  (`backend/src/provider-settings/provider-settings.service.ts`) — claude/openai
  dropped the per-user API key entirely in favor of a server-wide host-bridge (see
  "Host-bridge command execution" below), so there's no longer a credential to leak
  cross-user for those two providers. The `provider_credentials` table/model is kept in
  the schema (avoids a migration) but nothing writes to it anymore.
- `RefreshToken` rows are looked up by `id` (`tokenId` from the JWT payload)
  and then compared against `row.userId !== userId` before being trusted
  (`backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts` `refresh()`), so a stolen/forged
  refresh JWT for one user can't be replayed against another user's token
  row even if the `jti` happened to collide.
- The WebSocket gateway checks session ownership on `session:join` before
  adding the socket to that session's room (`backend/src/realtime/chat.gateway.ts`
  — outside this pass's remit, not modified here, but confirmed present).

**Open gap (documented, not fixed here)**: per the app's own
`ข้อจำกัดที่ทราบ` section in `README.md`, `chat:stop` does not verify the
stopping user owns the message being stopped, and artifact socket handlers
don't filter events by the client's current session. Both are pre-existing
gaps in `realtime/chat.gateway.ts`, which is another agent's active
territory during this pass — flagged here rather than fixed to avoid a merge
conflict.

## Token theft

**Risk**: an attacker obtains a user's access or refresh token and uses it
to impersonate them.

**Mitigated**:

- Access tokens are short-lived (`JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN`, default 15m) and
  kept in browser memory only (per `README.md`'s auth flow), not
  `localStorage` — limits the window and surface for XSS-based theft.
- Refresh tokens are `httpOnly` + `SameSite=Strict` cookies scoped to
  `/api/auth` (`backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`), so they're
  unreadable from JS and not sent cross-site.
- Refresh tokens are hashed (SHA-256) at rest, not stored plaintext
  (`hashToken()` in `auth.service.ts`) — a database read doesn't hand over
  usable tokens.
- Rotation + reuse detection: every refresh mints a new token and revokes
  the old one; if a revoked token is presented again (the signal that
  someone has a copy of an already-rotated token — i.e. theft), the entire
  token family is revoked, forcing re-authentication everywhere
  (`auth.service.ts` `refresh()` / `revokeFamilyAndAudit()`). This pass adds
  an audit-log entry (`auth.refresh.reuse_detected`) at that path so a theft
  event is now visible in logs, not just felt as "I got logged out".
- `secure` cookie flag is tied to `NODE_ENV === 'production'`
  (`auth.controller.ts`) — verified during this pass, not changed, since a
  real deploy needs a TLS-terminating layer for `Secure` to have teeth (see
  the HTTPS-enforcement note in `frontend/nginx.conf` and this pass's
  report).
- Login brute-forcing is throttled per-IP (5/min on `/api/auth/login`,
  `auth.controller.ts`), and every login attempt (success or failure) is now
  audit-logged with the user id (when known) and IP, not the password/email
  (`AuditLogService`, `backend/src/common/audit-log.service.ts`).

**Accepted risk / not addressed this pass**: no per-account lockout beyond
the IP-based throttle — deliberately, since a hard per-account lockout lets
an attacker lock a *victim* out by deliberately failing their login
repeatedly (a DoS on the legitimate user), which `plan.md` explicitly warns
against. The IP throttle plus reuse-detection-triggered mass revocation is
judged sufficient for this pass; a smarter exponential-backoff-per-(email,
IP) scheme is a reasonable future improvement but adds meaningful complexity
(in-memory state + TTL cleanup, or a new store) for a modest hardening gain
over what's already in place.

## Prompt injection

**Risk**: a malicious or compromised chat message tries to make the AI
ignore its system prompt, exfiltrate another user's data, or trick a user
into running/trusting malicious generated code.

**Not mitigated — accepted open risk.** Nothing in this codebase currently
detects or filters prompt-injection attempts in message content sent to
Ollama/Claude/OpenAI. This is a hard, actively-researched problem
(input/output filtering, structured tool-call boundaries, provider-side
guardrails) and doing it properly is out of scope for a hardening pass on an
otherwise-unrelated feature set. What *does* limit the blast radius even
without direct mitigation:

- Each user's data is already isolated by the cross-user-access controls
  above — a successful prompt injection in user A's own session can at
  worst make the AI misbehave *within A's own session*, since the AI has no
  tool/API access to other users' sessions, artifacts, or credentials. This app's own
  Ollama/Claude(API)/OpenAI(API) integrations never wire up function-calling/tool-use.
  The one exception is the optional claude/openai host-bridge (see "Host-bridge command
  execution" below), where the *underlying CLI* is a tool-capable coding agent by
  default — mitigated there, not by this app's own request/response handling.
- Artifact filenames extracted from AI output are strictly normalized
  (see below) before ever being used as a lookup key, so a prompt-injected
  response can't use a crafted filename to escape its own session's
  artifact namespace.
- Generated code is never executed server-side; it's only stored and shown
  in Monaco for the same user who requested it, so "AI writes malicious
  code" is a user-trust problem (the user is choosing to view/copy their own
  AI's output), not a server compromise.

If/when tool-use or cross-session AI capabilities are added, this section
needs to be revisited before shipping them.

## Host-bridge command execution (claude/codex, optional feature)

**Risk**: claude/openai are optionally backed by `host-bridge/`, which spawns the
deployment host's own `claude`/`codex` CLIs — both are coding agents that can run shell
commands and edit files by default. Without mitigation, any web user's chat message
could make the agent execute a real command or write a real file on the deployment
host, under the host operator's own login.

**Mitigated**:

- Every bridge invocation disables tool-use: `--tools ""` for claude, `--sandbox
  read-only` for codex (`host-bridge/src/claude.ts`, `host-bridge/src/codex.ts`).
  Verified by hand, not assumed: with `--tools ""` and a prompt asking it to run
  `whoami`, the model produced a *fabricated* plausible-looking answer rather than
  actually executing anything — confirming no tools were genuinely available, not just
  declined.
- Because a tool-less model will still confabulate a fake "I ran it, here's the output"
  answer if it believes it has tools, every invocation also prepends a system-prompt
  preamble stating explicitly that no tools exist and it must say so rather than
  inventing a result (`host-bridge/src/prompt.ts`'s `SAFETY_PREAMBLE`) — this is a
  correctness/trust mitigation, not an additional security boundary (the flags above
  are what actually prevents execution).
- Every spawned process runs with `cwd` set to a neutral scratch directory
  (`BRIDGE_NEUTRAL_CWD`, defaults to the OS temp dir) — deliberately outside any git
  repo and free of any `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, so a chat user's prompt can't pick up
  this repo's (or any other project's) own instructions/memory.
- The bridge only accepts requests carrying `HOST_BRIDGE_TOKEN` in an `x-bridge-token`
  header (`host-bridge/src/auth-middleware.ts`, constant-time compare) — anything else
  reachable on that host port cannot spawn the CLIs.

**Accepted risk / not fully closed**:

- `codex`'s `--sandbox read-only` is a genuine sandbox (blocks writes and most
  meaningfully dangerous operations) but is not verified to be as strictly "zero tool
  calls ever" as claude's `--tools ""` — codex may still be able to attempt read-only
  shell/file operations within the sandbox. Not tested further to avoid running up
  additional billed CLI calls purely to probe this; treat codex's floor as "sandboxed,
  not tool-free" until verified otherwise.
- Every web user of this deployment shares the **one** host operator's login/session —
  there's no per-user isolation, quota, or blast-radius limit at the CLI-auth level.
  This is inherent to the feature's whole premise (reuse the host's own subscription
  instead of per-user API keys) and is why `docs/deployment.md` calls this
  personal/small-team-only, not something safe to expose broadly.
- This entire feature is opt-in (unset `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_URL`/`CODEX_BRIDGE_URL` disables
  it entirely, falling back to "unavailable" for those two providers) — a deployment
  that never sets these env vars carries none of the above risk.

## Artifact filename attacks

**Risk**: a filename from AI output or a user's manual edit is used for
path traversal, collides with another artifact, or otherwise escapes its
intended scope.

**Mitigated**: `normalizeArtifactFilename()` in
`backend/src/artifacts/artifacts.service.ts` runs on every artifact
filename before it's used anywhere:

- Rejects control characters, absolute paths (`/foo`, `C:\foo`), and any
  path segment equal to `..` (both directly and after
  `path.posix.normalize()`, so this also cannot be bypassed with e.g.
  `a/../../etc/passwd`-style tricks that only look safe pre-normalization).
- Caps filename length at 255 UTF-8 bytes (`MAX_ARTIFACT_FILENAME_BYTES`).
- Normalizes backslashes to forward slashes so Windows-style traversal
  attempts (`..\\..\\`) are caught by the same checks as POSIX ones.
- Every artifact row is additionally scoped by `sessionId` in its unique
  constraint (`@@unique([sessionId, filename, revision])` in
  `schema.prisma`), so even a validated filename can't collide across
  sessions/users.

Artifacts are not written to the filesystem today (per this function's own
doc comment) — this normalization is forward-looking protection for if/when
artifact export-to-disk is added, and costs nothing to keep enforced now.

## Backoffice privilege escalation

**Risk**: a non-admin reaches `/api/admin/*`, an admin performs an action
they don't have specific permission for, or an admin locks themselves (or
the only other admin) out of the backoffice.

**Mitigated** (see `backend/src/admin/`, added in the Phase 8 pass):

- `PermissionsGuard` re-checks both `role === 'admin'` and the route's
  specific required `AdminPermission` **from the database on every request**
  — never from the JWT — so demoting a user or revoking a permission takes
  effect on their very next request instead of waiting out the access
  token's 15-minute lifetime.
- Every route that mutates a user's status, role, or permissions rejects
  (400) when the target is the caller themselves (`AdminUsersService`'s
  `assertNotSelf()`), so an admin can't accidentally deactivate, demote, or
  strip their own access.
- Demoting an admin to `user` atomically revokes all of their permission
  grants in the same transaction (`AdminUsersService.updateRole()`) — a
  later re-promotion never silently resurrects a stale permission set.
- Granting permissions is itself gated behind its own permission
  (`users_manage_permissions`), so only an admin explicitly trusted with
  that capability can expand another admin's access — an admin with, say,
  only `users_view` cannot escalate anyone, including themselves.
- Every mutation is written to `AdminAuditLogEntry` (actor, target, before/after)
  so a privilege change is always attributable after the fact, independent of
  the pino-only `AuditLogService` used for auth/provider events above.

**Accepted risk / operational caveat — `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS`**:
`AdminBootstrapService` idempotently re-grants full admin + every permission
to any email listed in this env var, on every backend startup and right
after that email registers. This is intentional — it's the mechanism that
keeps a known test account (`ake.kidsapon@gmail.com` in dev/staging) always
usable for exercising the backoffice — but it means **any email in that list
regains super-admin on every restart no matter what the backoffice UI was
used to change about it**. This is safe as long as the list is treated as
"who is allowed to always have full backoffice access," not as a one-time
seed. Before a real production launch: clear `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` (or
narrow it to accounts actually meant to be permanent super-admins) once real
admins are provisioned through the backoffice itself — otherwise anyone who
still controls one of those mailboxes has a standing, self-healing path back
to full admin that the UI cannot revoke.

## Unauthorized use by an unactivated (guest) account

**Risk**: anyone can self-register a free account today (no invite code, no email
verification) — without a gate, a freshly registered account would have the exact same
resource access as a vetted one, letting an anonymous signup immediately use the app's
compute (chat sessions against whichever AI providers are configured) or probe the API.

**Mitigated**: new registrations default to `role: 'guest'` (`User.role`'s DB default,
`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`), which can authenticate (so the frontend can show it a
clear "contact an admin" screen — `AccountPendingComponent`) but is blocked from every
actual resource:

- REST: `GuestBlockGuard` (`backend/src/auth/guards/guest-block.guard.ts`), a global
  `APP_GUARD`, default-denies any non-`@Public()` route for `role === 'guest'`, re-checked
  from the database on every request. Only `GET /api/users/me` opts back in
  (`@AllowGuest()`), so a guest can read its own status but touch nothing else.
- WebSocket: every `ChatGateway` message handler calls `requireActiveUser()` before doing
  any DB work, which rejects a guest's socket messages with a `WsException` even though
  the socket itself connects successfully (see the code comment on `handleConnection` for
  why the guest check deliberately isn't done at connect time — an async check there raced
  against the client's `'connect'` event in testing and let a guest's first message slip
  through before the disconnect landed).
- Promoting a guest to `user`/`admin` goes through the same audited, self-lockout-guarded
  `AdminUsersService.updateRole()` as any other role change (see above) — no separate,
  less-scrutinized code path for activation.

**Accepted, by design**: an activated account still has no further vetting beyond "an
admin clicked Activate" — this app has no email verification or invite-code system.
That's an intentional simplification (a human admin is the trust boundary), not an
oversight; add verification separately if self-serve signup ever needs to scale beyond
what a human can review.
